Introduction to yara-ctypes-python
**********************************

What's in yara-ctypes:

* A ctypes libyara wrapper module which exposes libyara's exports into the
  Python runtime (see: `yara-project's libyara v1.7`_).
* A thread safe Rules object with an interface that is compatible with the
  interface exposed in the yara-project CPython extension module.
* namespace management to allow easy loading of multiple YARA rules into a
  single Rules matching object. 
* Various Scanner class types to enable thread or process pool execution
  of matching requests over a Rules object.
* A feature rich command line interface that gives the user many options to
  control how they may wish to perform a scan.  


Why:

* ctypes releases the GIL on system function calls...  Run your PC to its
  true potential.
* It simplifies things a lot by keeping high order logic such as managing rules
  paths, filtering paths, controlling pooled execution, etc. inside of a
  language such as Python.
* No more building the PyC extension...  
* I found a few bugs and memory leaks and wanted to make my life simple.
