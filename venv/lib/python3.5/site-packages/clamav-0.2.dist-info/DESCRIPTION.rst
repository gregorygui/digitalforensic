ClamAV for Python
=================

ClamAV for Python lets you use the libclamav scanning engine from Python.

Why?
****

pyClamAV was abandoned in favor of pyClamd, which never worked for me well under Windows. As a result, I decided to roll my own bindings.

Requirements
************

- CFFI
- libclamav

Documentation
*************

There isn't any documentation right now, but the source shouldn't be difficult to read. Also check out ex.py, a simple example of how to use the engine.
